## 10/30/2025 - introduction and planning  

I have a lot of spare components from my projects in Highway and I wanna build something for Blueprint but I have no time for larger bc school
* this led me to thinking of many smaller projects that I can finish up when I have free time between classes (like now in ap stats), mainly comprising of stuff that I already have on hand
* I had a ton of SK6812s from a Highway project left over, which also led to me thinking of a way to add RGB lights to a project.

After some time, I came up with a light up ID badge holder

> the name _Polychrome_ is a balatro reference btw :3

I plan on having a heavy futuristic cyberpunk/futuristic vibe to the project, mainly drawing inspo from the Undercity PCB badges and some of my other projects ([wink wink](https://github.com/geg-tech/cheapsuit)).
I also plan on using parts that I have on hand. As stated earlier, I already have a bunch of SK6812s for RGB, but I'm also scrapping some parts of my Sprig for the microcontroller ann buttons and a coin battery holder from Solder.
* I read online that a Raspberry Pi Pico can be powered with 3V, as well as SK6812 LEDS (to an extent), so _hopefully_ this should work out
